<h1>The SDR.hu project has been finished</h1>
<p>
    I'd like to say a big thanks to everyone who joined my journey with this project!<br><br>

I hope you had a good time listening on the site, and learnt some things about SDR. The purpose of this site was to provide a technological demonstration for amateur radio operators about Software Defined Radio, and I hope this goal has been reached. As this website was a one-person hobby project, with my tasks and responsibilities growing, and my focus moving to other projects at which I hope to make a greater positive impact, I'm unable to further develop SDR.hu and protect it from abuse.<br><br>

Furthermore, I think this site has some good alternatives now. Nevertheless, in my opinion amateur radio receivers should be shared with strict access control in the future.<br><br>

If you have more questions, feel free to consult the <a href="#faq">FAQ</a>. <br><br>

<h2>FAQ</h2>

<a name="faq"></a>
<p><em>Why has the site been closed?</em></p>
<p>As stated above, it was a one-person hobby project, and I don't have the capacity anymore to neither develop or maintain the site, nor protect it from abuse.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Where can I download OpenWebRX and CSDR?</em></p>
<p>You can still find <a href="https://github.com/ha7ilm/openwebrx">OpenWebRX</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ha7ilm/csdr">CSDR</a> on GitHub, and also my <a href="/static/bsc-thesis.pdf">BSc</a> and <a href="/static/msc-thesis.pdf">MSc</a> theses on them.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Can I still use my KiwiSDR?</em></p>
<p>The short answer is: <b>yes</b>. The KiwiSDR is self-hosted, so people who know the URL of your receiver will be able to access it. SDR.hu only provided a list of receivers for easier access.<br><br>
Note also that this website was not affiliated directly with the company developing and selling the KiwiSDR: it was a one-person hobby project instead. If you have KiwiSDR related questions, you can always reach that company through their e-mail address on <a href="http://kiwisdr.com/">kiwisdr.com</a>.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>I paid for a KiwiSDR. Why did you close down the "network of KiwiSDR receivers"?</em></p>
<p>I didn't do so, as SDR.hu was not a "network of KiwiSDR receivers". It was a hobby project, a free service that provided a list of the open source OpenWebRX-based SDR receivers, that also included the KiwiSDRs, but not exclusively. I don't think I've made a promise either on how long would this personal project last. Furthermore, the KiwiSDR is self-hosted, so people who know the URL of your receiver will still be able to access it.<br><br> 
Note also that this website was not affiliated directly with the company developing and selling the KiwiSDR. If you have KiwiSDR related questions, you can always reach that company through their e-mail address on <a href="http://kiwisdr.com/">kiwisdr.com</a>.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>SDR.hu was the only way for me to listen to amateur radio. What do I do now?</em></p
<p>I'm very sorry to hear that. Unfortunately, some people (including me) don't have the possibility to install antennas at home. The purpose of the site however was to be a technological demonstration of the possibilities of Software Defined Radio. It was not the purpose to totally replace real-world amateur radio equipment for you.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Will you help me with OpenWebRX related problems?</em></p>
<p>No, I'm sorry, due to lack of time I am unable to help hams with OpenWebRX related problems. Note that I don't work on OpenWebRX anymore either. If you have questions regarding my old projects, make sure you first try to find the solution in the Wiki section of the project on GitHub.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Will you help me with KiwiSDR related problems?</em></p>
<p>No, I'm sorry, I'm not affiliated directly with the company developing and selling the KiwiSDR. If you have KiwiSDR related questions, you can always reach the company through their e-mail address on <a href="http://kiwisdr.com/">kiwisdr.com</a>.</p>
</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>I have more questions about SDR.hu and OpenWebRX, and I sent you an e-mail. When will you reply?</em></p>
<p>I'm very sorry, I don't want to be impolite, but I'm so overwhelmed with e-mails about those projects already that there is a chance I won't reply to some of them.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>I used your website in my job, for non-amateur purposes. What do I do now?</em></p>
<p>Well, you were not allowed to do so. This website was for amateur radio only, right from the beginning.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>After the site has been closed, what happened to the personal data that I provided during registration and usage?</em></p>
<p>All personal data has been deleted from the database of the website, and will be deleted from all backups within 2 year.<br/>(The last privacy policy of SDR.hu is still available <a href="/privacy-policy.pdf">here</a>.)</p>
